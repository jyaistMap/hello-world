# hello-world
Repository for ideas, resources, and learning Github through the guides.github tutorial.

I'm John Yaist, lover of maps and all-around fun. I've worked with geographic information
in a technical capacity since 2000, and have slowly been learning programming since 2011.
This exercise is an adventure in learning how to use github.
